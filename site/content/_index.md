# Talarius Gaming Group

Welcome to the home of the Talarius Gaming Group! We're a group of students, alumni, and friends who play tabletop games together. Many of us are from the University of Rochester and are past or current members of [URSGA](http://ursga.org/). This collaborative site hosts information and resources for the games we run and play in.

## Current Games

These are all of our active games. We usually have a few running at once these days, and not all of us participate in every game. If you're bored and want to help one of our GMs, take a peek at the [NPC Ideas](#) page and drop in a quick character idea!

## Upcoming and Suspended Games

These are games we're planning to run or resume in the near future. Games with player openings will be advertised as we're able.

## Past Games

All of the info from our retired campaigns can be found through these links, ready for reference. They're listed by the date they ended, with the most recently ended game first.

## Systems

These are the systems we've used for our games with the abbreviations used above. Follow the links for more info if you're curious about a system!

* NWoD - [New World of Darkness](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/) (1st Ed.) by White Wolf, a modern-day, low fantasy, horror setting using a d10 system. These campaigns draw from sources spanning all of the NWoD game lines, including _[Vampire: The Requiem](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/vampiretherequiem/)_, _[Werewolf: The Forsaken](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/werewolftheforsaken/)_, _[Mage: The Awakening](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/magetheawakening/)_, _[Promethean: The Created](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/prometheanthecreated/)_, _[Changeling: The Lost](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/changelingthelost/)_, _[Hunter: The Vigil](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/hunterthevigil/)_, and _[Geist: The Sin-Eaters](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/geistthesineaters/)_. _Note: NWoD was re-released in 2012 as Chronicles of Darkness. It was also redeveloped with new core rules. All of our games labeled "NWoD" use the original first edition rules._
  * NWoD/Changeling - These games focus on _Changeling: The Lost_, and probably don't include material from other NWoD game lines.
  * NWoD/Homebrew - These games build on the core New World of Darkness rules with new powers, abilities, and creatures.
* [Eclipse Phase](http://www.eclipsephase.com/) - Future, trans-human settings spanning the solar system, using a d% system. Rules available under a Creative Commons license.
* [Nexus d%](#) - Custom system created by Henry Kwan.

  * [FATE/DFRPG](https://www.evilhat.com/home/dresden-files-rpg/) - Dresden Files RPG. Extends FATE to support the oddities of the Dresden Files universe.
  * [FATE/Diaspora](http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html) - Space exploration using FATE.
* [D&D 3.5](http://www.d20srd.org/) - Dungeons and Dragons 3.5, by Wizards of the Coast.
* [Vampire: The Masquerade](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/classicworldofdarkness/vampirethemasquerade/) - One game line from (Classic) World of Darkness, by White Wolf. Modern-day, low fantasy, horror setting revolving around vampires and their politics, using a d10 system.
